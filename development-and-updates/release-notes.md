# Release Notes

### Release Notes

Release notes are your go-to resource for staying updated on what’s new, improved, or fixed within edEHR and edEHR Compass. Each set of notes is published in advance of deployment updates, providing a clear overview of new features, bug fixes, performance enhancements, and details about any programs or interfaces that may be affected.

A public link to release notes is available, but please note that the link may be unique to your institution depending on server configuration. If you’re not sure which link applies to you, check with your administrator for guidance.

Release schedules can vary across institutions. Timing may be influenced by program blackout dates or other scheduling needs specific to your organization. New updates are always pushed to demo servers first, giving users a chance to explore, test, and provide feedback before wider rollout. Keep an eye on the demo environment to see what’s coming next and to get hands-on with upcoming changes.
