# New Feature Requests

### New Feature Requests

This section is dedicated to new feature requests from current edEHR clients & users. If you’re not yet a user and want to learn more about the platform or how to get involved, please contact xyz for more information.

For current users, the client portal is your go-to place for submitting feature requests and providing feedback. Here’s how the process works:

1. Submit a new feature request through the client portal.
2. The edEHR team will review your submission. If approved, your request will be queued for development.
3. If a request needs additional information, subject matter expert collaboration, or broader feedback from other participating institutions, the team will reach out for further input.
4. You can monitor the status of your requests directly through the client portal.

To learn more about the client portal, visit the Client Portal page or contact xyz.

Your ideas and feedback from across the PSI community are invaluable. Every request helps edEHR grow in ways that are most meaningful and sustainable for everyone involved.
