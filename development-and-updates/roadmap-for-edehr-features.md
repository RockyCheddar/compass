# Roadmap for edEHR Features

Transparency and collaboration are central to the EdEHR and edEHR Compass approach. The public roadmap offers a clear view of key features in development, upcoming priorities, and current projects.

This roadmap serves as a resource for institutions and the broader community to stay informed, provide feedback, and help influence the future direction of edEHR Compass. By sharing these plans openly, the platform encourages users to weigh in, support new features, and engage in the ongoing evolution of the system.
