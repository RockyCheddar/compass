### **For Students**

Your journey into EdEHR begins in your school's Learning Management System (LMS). There are no separate accounts or logins to manage. To begin your first charting assignment, simply find the activity link in your course and click on it.

* **Your next step:** For a complete walkthrough of the student dashboard, charting features, and how to view feedback, go to the [**Student Quick Start Guide**.](https://app.gitbook.com/s/cHC5valsK2qsuRUKHH2u/student-guides)

***

### **For Instructors**

You can start building and managing your EdEHR activities in minutes. The main workflow involves creating an "External Tool" link in your LMS course, which then connects to EdEHR content.&#x20;

From there, you can manage class lists, track progress, and evaluate student work.

* **Your next step:** To learn how to create your first activity, connect to a case study, and manage your course, proceed to the [**Instructor Quick Start Guide**.](https://app.gitbook.com/s/cHC5valsK2qsuRUKHH2u/instructor-guides)

### **For Course Designers**

If your role involves creating new, reusable learning content, your starting point is the Course Designer Guides. This is where you can build rich, detailed patient scenarios from the ground up.

* **Your next step:** To explore the tools for building and customizing content, please see our complete guide on [**Course Designer Guide**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/cHC5valsK2qsuRUKHH2u/course-designer)

### For Simulation Technologists / Educational Implementation

If you support hands-on learning or simulation environments, this section is for you. Here you’ll find resources on configuring EdEHR for your labs, integrating with simulation equipment, and best practices for running live or virtual scenarios.

* **Your next step:** For guidance on setup, troubleshooting, and maximizing EdEHR in simulation settings, see the [**Simulation Technologist & Implementation Guide**.](https://app.gitbook.com/o/QGScpOxwAqjwttV41sws/s/KTwDHXk4FzFWHXSJ6PFq/)

### Key Terms Primer

As you explore the guides, you will encounter a few core terms. Here’s a quick overview of what they mean:

* **Activity:** This is the assignment or task you create in your LMS that links students to the EdEHR system. It's the bridge between the two platforms.
* **Case Study:** This is the patient record itself. It contains all the charting information, medical history, lab results, and orders that a student will interact with.
* **Learning Object:** A reusable package that bundles a Case Study together with specific instructions, learning objectives, and settings for an assignment.
