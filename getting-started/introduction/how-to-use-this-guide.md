# How to use this guide

## Introduction to the edEHR Compass Platform

Welcome! Whether you’re brand new to EdEHR Compass or just need a refresher, this page will help you get the most out of our knowledge base. Here’s how to find what you need, contribute your own expertise, and make your experience as smooth as possible.

GitBook is an online documentation platform designed for collaborative knowledge sharing. This GitBook serves as a knowledge base for our open-source platform, covering walkthroughs, best practices, troubleshooting, and more.





## 1. Navigating the Table of Contents and Sections

#### Table of Contents:

The left-hand sidebar is your roadmap. Topics are organized into sections and subsections. Click on any section to expand and see more details. If you ever feel lost, use the breadcrumbs at the top of the page to see where you are and jump back to previous sections.

Page Layout:

* Each page starts with a clear heading and a brief overview. Key steps, tips, and links are highlighted for quick scanning.
* Use the breadcrumbs at the top to track your location within the documentation.

### Primary Section Navigation

At the top of every page, you'll find the main navigation bar. Just click any section name to jump straight to that part of the guide. It's always there, so you can easily switch topics or head back to where you want to be with one click.

### Side Page Table of Contents

On the right side of each page, you’ll find a mini table of contents. This lets you quickly jump to different sections within the page, making it easy to scan or revisit key topics without scrolling.

### Pagination

At the bottom of each page, you’ll find Next and Previous buttons. Use these to move smoothly through the guide in order, just like flipping pages in a book. It’s a quick way to keep your place or continue exploring without heading back to the table of contents.
