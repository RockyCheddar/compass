### Why EHR Training Matters

Modern healthcare now runs on electronic health records (EHRs). Graduates who can navigate, chart, and reason with EHR data:

* **Protect patient safety** through accurate, privacy‑compliant documentation.
* **Add immediate value** on clinical placements instead of learning basic clicks on site.
* **Meet employer expectations**—EHR proficiency is often a hiring requirement.

Without a classroom EHR, students still learn ​paper charting—a skill they will never use professionally—and lose precious clinical time relearning on a live system.

### What EdEHR?

EdEHR is an open‑source, Canadian‑built educational EHR designed _for learning first_.

| Core Feature                    | Detail                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose‑built for education** | Cases, workflows, and analytics focus on learning outcomes, not billing.                                      |
| **Interprofessional**           | Supports nursing, med‑lab, allied health, and more—ideal for team‑based scenarios.                            |
| **Highly customizable**         | Instructors can tailor forms, cases, and vocabularies to local curricula.                                     |
| **Open source**                 | Code lives on GitHub; institutions avoid vendor lock‑in.                                                      |
| **SaaS delivery**               | Hosted by EdEHR Technologies Inc. on a per‑active‑student‑seat model and integrates with existing LMS logins. |
