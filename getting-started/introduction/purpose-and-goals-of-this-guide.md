### **Why EdEHR Compass Exists**

Electronic Health Records (EHR) have become prevalent in healthcare settings across British Columbia, Canada, and globally. Healthcare students and recent graduates must develop practical knowledge of these systems to ensure patient safety and meet employment requirements. However, many institutions face significant challenges when implementing educational EHR systems like EdEHR:

* Lack of structured implementation resources
* Limited guidance on curriculum integration
* Technical deployment uncertainties
* Content development challenges
* Governance and sustainability questions

EdEHR Compass addresses these barriers by providing a comprehensive blueprint for successful EdEHR adoption based on years of real-world implementation experience from pioneers across multiple British Columbia post-secondary institutions.
