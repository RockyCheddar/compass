# Benefits of edEHR for Health Care Education

The integration of technology into healthcare education has become increasingly essential in preparing students for the complexities of modern clinical environments. The Educational Electronic Health Record (EdEHR) system, is a platform designed to simulate real-world electronic health records (EHRs) for educational purposes. EdEHR offers a multitude of benefits that enhance the learning experience for healthcare students, bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, and ultimately contribute to developing clinical informatics compencies in healthcare students.&#x20;

#### 1. Realistic Clinical Simulation

EdEHR provides a simulated environment that mirrors the functionalities of actual EHR systems used in healthcare settings. This allows students to engage with patient data, health histories, assessment data, and clinical documentation in an educational context. By interacting with lifelike case studies and patient records, learners develop a deeper understanding of clinical workflows and decision-making processes. This hands-on experience helps in preparing students for the demands of real-world healthcare environments. ​

#### 2. Enhanced Clinical Decision-Making Skills

The use of EdEHR enables students to practice critical thinking and clinical reasoning by analyzing patient information and making informed decisions regarding care plans. The platform's interactive nature encourages learners to assess data comprehensively, consider  diagnoses, and determine appropriate interventions and care. This iterative process of evaluation and decision-making fosters the development of competencies essential for effective patient care. ​

#### 3. Improved Documentation Proficiency

EdEHR familiarizes students with the documentation standards and practices prevalent in clinical settings. Through repeated use, learners become adept at recording patient information, charting progress notes, and updating patient health records. This proficiency not only enhances their efficiency but also reduces the likelihood of errors, thereby promoting patient safety. ​ (REFS)

#### 4. Interprofessional Collaboration

EdEHR supports interprofessional education by allowing students from diverse healthcare disciplines to work together within the same simulated environment. This collaborative approach fosters mutual understanding of each profession's roles and responsibilities, enhances teamwork skills, and prepares students for integrated patient care practices. ​

#### 5. Seamless Integration with Learning Management Systems

EdEHR is designed to integrate effortlessly with various Learning Management Systems (LMS) that are LTI-compliant, such as Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, and D2L. This compatibility ensures that educational institutions can incorporate EdEHR into their existing curricula without significant infrastructural changes. The seamless integration facilitates streamlined access for both instructors and students, enhancing the overall educational experience. &#x20;

#### 6. Customizable Educational Content

Recognizing the diverse needs of healthcare programs, EdEHR offers customizable case studies and learning modules. Educators can tailor content to align with specific learning objectives, clinical scenarios, and competency requirements. This flexibility ensures that the educational material remains relevant and engaging, catering to the unique demands of various healthcare disciplines.

#### 7. Accessibility and Cost-Effectiveness

As an open-source platform, EdEHR provides an accessible and cost-effective solution for educational institutions. Schools can choose to host the application themselves or utilize services provided by EdEHR, depending on their resources and needs. This adaptability makes it feasible for a wide range of institutions to implement the system, thereby broadening the reach of enhanced healthcare education. ​

#### 8. Preparation for Technological Proficiency in Healthcare

&#x20;EdEHR equips students with the necessary skills to navigate and utilize EHRs effectively. This technological competence is crucial, as it enhances workflow efficiency, supports clinical decision-making, and contributes to better patient outcomes. (REFS)

#### 9. Continuous Feedback and Assessment

EdEHR enables instructors to monitor student progress in real-time, providing opportunities for immediate feedback and assessment. Educators can review documentation entries, evaluate clinical decisions, and offer constructive guidance. This continuous feedback loop is essential for reinforcing learning, identifying areas for improvement, and ensuring that students achieve the desired competencies. &#x20;

#### 10. Alignment with Modern Healthcare Practices

By learning with EdEHR, students become familiar with the digital tools and processes they will encounter in their professional careers. This alignment with current industry standards ensures a smoother transition from education to practice, as graduates are already accustomed to the technological landscape of modern healthcare. ​

#### Conclusion

The Educational Electronic Health Record (EdEHR) system stands as a pivotal tool in the evolution of healthcare education. By providing a realistic, interactive, and customizable platform, EdEHR bridges the gap between classroom learning and clinical practice. Its myriad benefits, ranging from enhanced clinical decision-making to improved documentation skills, prepare students to excel in a technologically advanced healthcare environment. As the healthcare industry continues to evolve, integrating tools like EdEHR into educational curricula will be instrumental in cultivating competent, confident, and proficient healthcare professionals
