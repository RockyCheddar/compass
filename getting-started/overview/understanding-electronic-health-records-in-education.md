# Understanding Electronic Health Records in Education

The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in healthcare education is increasingly essential for preparing students to thrive in today’s digitally connected clinical environments. EHRs are digital systems that store patient information—such as medical histories, diagnostic data, treatment plans, and progress notes—in a centralized, accessible format. Their real-time nature supports fast and informed decision-making, making them indispensable tools in modern healthcare.

Incorporating EHR training into healthcare curricula equips students with the competencies needed to:

* Accurately document patient care
* Retrieve and interpret clinical data
* Make informed decisions using digital tools
* Understand the flow of clinical information within healthcare teams

Platforms like **EdEHR** provide safe, simulated environments where students can engage with EHR systems in context-rich scenarios. These simulations enable learners to develop fluency in data entry and clinical reasoning, while also reinforcing best practices in patient communication and interprofessional collaboration.

Through EdEHR and similar educational tools, students gain exposure to real-world challenges, preparing them not only to interact with health information systems, but also to appreciate their impact on workflow efficiency, patient safety, and overall care quality.

As healthcare continues to digitize, developing EHR literacy in education is no longer optional—it’s foundational.
