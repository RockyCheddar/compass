# EdEHR vs other EHR systems

### **What is EdEHR?**

EdEHR is an open-source, educational electronic health record (EHR) system designed for healthcare education programs in Canada. It prioritizes student learning, offering a simulated EHR experience that prepares students for clinical practice.

#### **Key Features:**

* **Education-Focused:** Designed specifically for teaching and learning, not for live patient care.
* **Canadian-Based:** Developed with Canadian healthcare education needs in mind.
* **Open-Source:** Allows for customization and adaptation by educational institutions.
* **Interprofessional:** Can support collaboration across multiple healthcare disciplines.
* **LMS Integration:** Seamlessly connects with post-secondary institution learning management systems.
* **Customizable Case Studies:** Educators can create and modify case studies to fit program needs.
* **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):** Hosted externally, reducing IT infrastructure demands on schools.

### **What EdEHR Isn't**

* **Not a Clinical EHR System:** Unlike Cerner, Epic, or Meditech, EdEHR is not used for actual patient care in hospitals or clinics.
* **Not a Vendor-Owned Proprietary System:** Unlike ChartFlow or GoEHR, it is open-source and adaptable.
* **Not a One-Size-Fits-All Solution:** Customization is required to fit specific program needs.
* **Not Fully Self-Sustaining Yet:** It relies on institutional funding for continued development and support.
