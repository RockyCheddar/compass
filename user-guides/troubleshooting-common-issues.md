# Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Student access problems

If students can't access activities:

* Ensure you've completed the connection and linking steps for the Activity
* Verify the student is properly enrolled in the LMS course
* Check that the activity is available and not restricted

### Evaluation issues

* **Can't see student submissions**: Ensure the work has been submitted by the student or use "Force submission"
* **Changes to notes don't save**: Ensure you've clicked the Save button in the evaluation panel
* **Can't navigate between students**: Check your browser for compatibility issues

### Getting help

* Consult the EdEHR documentation at edehr.org
* Contact your institution's EdEHR administrator
* Email [support@edehr.org](mailto:support@edehr.org) for technical assistance
