# Student Orientation

This guide outlines best practices for planning and implementing student orientation to EdEHR. While originally developed with BCIT’s approach in mind, the following recommendations are adaptable to a variety of institutional contexts. The goal is to ensure students are confident and prepared to use EdEHR as a learning tool throughout their academic program.

* Identification of the Target Audience
* Estimated Time Requirements for Planning and Implementation
* Prerequisites
* Resources and Materials Needed
* Step-by-Step Orientation Process
* Best Practices and Tips

### Overview

A well-designed orientation introduces students to the EdEHR platform, its purpose in healthcare education, and how it will be used in their courses. Effective orientation supports both student learning and overall program success.

### Target Audience

Orientation is recommended for all students who will use EdEHR as part of their curriculum, as well as the faculty and staff responsible for supporting them.

### Time Requirements

Schedule orientation sessions before the start of term to ensure students are ready for coursework involving EdEHR. Allow time for both self-paced and live learning activities.

### Prerequisites

Make sure the EdEHR platform is accessible to all students and that relevant documentation is available. Confirm that students have access to required devices and basic technical skills.

### Schedule Coordination

Consider integrating orientation into official course hours so all students can participate. Coordinate with course leads and simulation coordinators to book appropriate spaces or set up virtual sessions.

* Confirm date, time, and schedule details with Term Lead and Simulation Coordinator
* Ensure orientation is integrated into official course hours
* Block appropriate rooms for synchronous sessions (computer labs preferred)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Learning Hub Preparation

Verify that all learning materials and simulations are ready for students before the session. Test access from a student perspective to catch any issues early.

* Verify EdEHR has been properly uploaded to Learning Hub
* Test access from student perspective
* Ensure all necessary case studies and simulations are available
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Learning Materials Setup

Aim to provide clear instructions and resources in advance so students know what to expect and how to prepare.

* Upload orientation instructions and pre-learning materials
* Share assignment requirements and access instructions
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Pre-Learning Assignment

Encourage students to complete a brief self-paced module before attending the live session. This helps maximize engagement and ensures everyone starts with the basics.

* Assign a pre-learning module covering EdEHR introduction, navigation, key features, and its role in healthcare education
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Synchronous Training Session

Consider making the live session interactive and hands-on. Activities like “Seek and Find” or “Escape Room” challenges can boost engagement and help students learn by doing.

* Introduce the platform’s purpose and benefits
* Provide step-by-step access instructions
* Identify student EdEHR champions for peer support
* Run interactive activities and barcode scanning practice
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Follow-up Support

Set up ongoing support so students know where to turn with questions or technical issues. Encourage continued practice and skill development.

* Identify faculty point person for student questions
* Establish process for troubleshooting technical issues
* Set expectations for continued practice and skill development
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Best Practices and Tips

* Tailor orientation to the needs and experience level of your students
* Blend self-paced and live learning for flexibility
* Use interactive activities to foster engagement
* Collect feedback to improve future sessions
* Keep support materials current and easy to access



This general guide is designed to be adaptable. Institutions are encouraged to customize the process to fit their unique student needs and EdEHR implementation timelines.
