# Faculty Orientation

This guide outlines best practices for planning and implementing faculty orientation to edEHR. While originally developed with BCIT’s approach in mind, While originally developed with BCIT’s approach in mind, the following recommendations are adaptable to a variety of institutional contexts.&#x20;

The aim is to ensure that faculty are confident, prepared, and equipped to integrate EdEHR tools into their teaching.

### Overview

A well-structured orientation introduces faculty to the EdEHR platform, its educational value, and its practical applications. Effective orientation supports both faculty and student success.

### Target Audience

Orientation is recommended for all faculty who will use EdEHR, including simulation coordinators, course leads, instructional designers, and faculty development teams.

### Time Requirements

Schedule orientation sessions before the start of term, ideally one to two weeks before faculty are expected to use EdEHR. Allow time for both asynchronous (self-paced) and synchronous (live) learning components.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the EdEHR platform is accessible to all faculty and that relevant documentation is available. Confirm that faculty have basic technical skills and access to required devices.



### Key Steps for Faculty Orientation

{% step %}
### Schedule Coordination

* Confirm date, time, and schedule details with:
  * Term Lead
  * Simulation Coordinator
  * Faculty Development Coordinator
* Schedule orientation approximately one week prior to first planned use of EdEHR
* Reserve appropriate physical or virtual spaces for synchronous sessions
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Learning Hub Preparation

* Verify EdEHR has been properly uploaded to the faculty development site
* Test access from faculty perspective
* Ensure all necessary teaching materials and case studies are available
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Learning Materials Setup

Simulation Coordinator or edEHR coordinator / lead should update Learning Hub with:

* Orientation instructions
* Pre-learning materials
* Teaching resources
* Access instructions
* Course-specific implementation guides
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Pre-Learning Assignment

Direct faculty to complete the following pre-learning module before attending synchronous sessions:

This module covers:

* Introduction to EdEHR
* Basic navigation
* Overview of key features
* Educational applications of the platform
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Synchronous  Session(s)

Consider tailoring the session format and content to your faculty’s experience level and comfort with technology. You might offer separate sessions for new and returning users, or adjust the depth of coverage based on participant needs.

Host a live session (virtual or in-person) covering:

* Platform overview and educational benefits
* Administrative features and faculty tools
* Strategies for integrating EdEHR into coursework
* Q and A and troubleshooting
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Hands-On Practice

Think about designing hands-on activities that mirror real teaching scenarios or common challenges faculty may face. Encourage collaboration and peer learning during these sessions to maximize engagement.

* Offer guided practice with core EdEHR features
* Facilitate creation or modification of sample assignments or case studies
* Encourage faculty to explore the platform as students would
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Ongoing Support

* Establish a faculty mentoring system
* Schedule regular check-ins with EdEHR Champion
* Create a repository of resources and FAQ
* Plan refresher sessions as needed
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Best Practices & Tips

* Tailor orientation to the specific needs of each faculty group or course
* Blend asynchronous and synchronous learning for flexibility
* Encourage active participation and peer sharing
* Collect feedback to improve future orientations
* Maintain up-to-date support materials

### Additional Resources:&#x20;

* Sample lesson plans
* Assessment rubrics
* Troubleshooting guides
* Teaching strategies for common challenges

This general guide is designed to be adaptable. Institutions are encouraged to customize the process to fit their unique faculty development needs and EdEHR implementation timelines.
