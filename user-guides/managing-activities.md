# Managing Activities

## Understanding Activities

An Activity is automatically created when a user clicks an LMS Activity. After this first click, all users who click that LMS Activity can access the EdEHR Activity. An EdEHR Course is also created automatically when needed.

* When **students** click an LMS Activity, they're automatically added to the class list and taken to the charting area.
* When **instructors** click the LMS Activity, they're taken to the EdEHR Activity page.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: Every EdEHR Activity must be linked to a Learning Object to provide the case study. When creating new activities each semester, instructors must try each activity and link it to the desired Learning Object.
