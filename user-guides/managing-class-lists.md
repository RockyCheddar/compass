# Managing Class Lists

## Viewing your class list

All users access the EdEHR via their learning management system (LMS). The LMS provides authentication and authorization, determining whether a user is a student or instructor. When student users access the EdEHR, they are added to the class list for the EdEHR Activity.&#x20;

Instructors can view this class list and access the Learning Object and Case Study.

To access the class list:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### From the Activity page, click on the '&#x43;_&#x6C;ass list'_ Tab
