# Creating your first edEHR Activity

This page is your step-by-step guide to setting up your very first EdEHR activity in your LMS. We’ll keep it simple, practical, and easy to follow, so you can get your students exploring EdEHR content with minimal hassle.

What You’ll Learn Here

* How to create an LMS activity and link it to EdEHR
* The basics of connecting to a Learning Object
* Tips for avoiding common setup mistakes
* What your students will experience once it’s live



#### Getting Started: Why Start Simple?

For your first EdEHR activity, less is more. Start with an easy assignment where students explore an existing case study, like Erin Johns, and report their findings. This lets you and your students get comfortable with the system before diving into custom content.

## Step 1: Create the LMS Activity

The following instructions use Moodle as an example, but the process is similar in other LMS platforms:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### In your LMS course, select "Turn editing on"

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Step 1 2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Click "Add activity or resource"

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/LMS Activty Step 2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Select "External tool" from the list

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Step 3 2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Configure the activity

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Step 4 2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

* Enter an **Activity name** (this will be the link text students click on)
* Select the preconfigured tool your LMS admin created for EdEHR
* Add a description about the activity for your students (click "show more" to add description)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Save and return to course
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Step 2: Activate the Connection

**This step is critical.**&#x20;

Click the LMS activity link you just created. This action generates the corresponding EdEHR activity and ensures your students get routed to the right place.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: This step must be completed by an instructor before any student attempts to use the activity. The LMS passes a unique identifier for each LMS Activity to EdEHR, ensuring all users who click that link will access the same EdEHR Activity.
{% endhint %}

***

## Step 3: Connect to a Learning Object

Before students can access your activity, you must connect it to content:

1. Click on your new activity link from the LMS
2. You'll be taken to the "Unlinked Activity" page
3. You have two options:
   * **Option 1**: Connect to an existing Learning Object. Browse the list, select the one you want, and click connect. Confirm when prompted.
   * **Option 2**: Create a new Learning Object. Click “Create new,” fill in the name, description, and select an initial case study. Save, then select your new object for the activity.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important**: Once an Activity is linked to a Learning Object, the link cannot be changed. If you make a mistake, you'll need to recreate the activity in your LMS and start again.
{% endhint %}

#### Quick Checklist before you go live

* [ ] Instructor has clicked the link to activate the edEHR activity
* [ ] Activity is connected to the right Learning Object
