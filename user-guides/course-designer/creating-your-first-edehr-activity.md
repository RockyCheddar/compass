# Creating your first edEHR Activity

This page is your step-by-step guide to setting up your very first EdEHR activity in your LMS. We’ll keep it simple, practical, and easy to follow, so you can get your students exploring EdEHR content with minimal hassle.

What You’ll Learn Here

* How to create an LMS activity and link it to EdEHR
* The basics of connecting to a Learning Object
* Tips for avoiding common setup mistakes
* What your students will experience once it’s live



#### Getting Started: Why Start Simple?

For your first EdEHR activity, less is more. Start with an easy assignment where students explore an existing case study, like Erin Johns, and report their findings. This lets you and your students get comfortable with the system before diving into custom content.



***

## Step 1: Create the LMS Activity

The following instructions use Moodle as an example. The process is similar in other LMS platforms, with these key differences:

* **Moodle**: Look for "External tool" in the activity/resource list
* **D2L (Brightspace)**: Use "External Learning Tools" or "LTI Link" from the Content menu
* **Canvas**: Add an "External Tool" from the module or assignment options

Regardless of platform, you'll need to select the preconfigured EdEHR tool that your LMS administrator has set up. If you don't see an EdEHR option, contact your IT or EdTech support team.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Select "External tool" from the list

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Configure the activity

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Step 4 2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

* Enter an **Activity name** (this will be the link text students click on)
* Select the preconfigured tool your LMS admin created for EdEHR
* Add a description about the activity for your students (click "show more" to add description)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Save and return to course
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Step 2: Initialize the EdEHR Activity (Instructor Must Go First)

**You must be the first person to click your new activity link** before any students access it. Here's why this matters:

When you (the instructor) click the LMS activity link for the first time, it triggers EdEHR to:
1. Create a corresponding EdEHR Activity
2. Register you as the instructor for this activity
3. Generate a unique connection between your LMS course and EdEHR
4. Prepare the activity to receive student submissions

**What to do**: Simply click the LMS activity link you just created in Step 1. You'll be taken to EdEHR where you can complete Step 3.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Critical**: If a student clicks the link before you do, they may be registered as the instructor, causing access and grading problems. Always test your activities yourself before making them visible to students.
{% endhint %}

## Step 3: Link Your Activity to a Learning Object

After completing Step 2 (clicking the activity link for the first time), you'll arrive at the "Unlinked Activity" page in EdEHR. This is where you connect your activity to actual patient case content.

**Choose one of these options**:

* **Option 1 - Use existing content** (recommended for first activity):
  1. Browse the list of available Learning Objects
  2. Select one that matches your learning goals (e.g., "Erin Johns - General Assessment")
  3. Click "Connect" and confirm when prompted

* **Option 2 - Create new content** (for custom cases):
  1. Click "Create new Learning Object"
  2. Enter a name and description that students will see
  3. Select a case study to associate with it
  4. Save, then connect your new Learning Object to this activity

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important**: Once an Activity is linked to a Learning Object, the link cannot be changed. If you make a mistake, you'll need to recreate the activity in your LMS and start again.
{% endhint %}
