## Adding a medication record to a case study

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Enter EdEHR in Course Designer Mode
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Select the relevant case study

Either via a linked activity or from the Case Studies menu.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Sign in as the appropriate healthcare professional

For example, Nurse for medication administration.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Navigate to the medication orders section
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Add a new medication

* Use the standardized medication list/library if available.
* Copy and paste the medication name directly from the list to ensure barcode compatibility.
* Enter the dose, route, and any other required details.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Save your changes

(Optional) If the medication isn't in the library, document your process and notify your admin or support contact.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** For barcode scanning, always use the exact medication name and dose as in your institution's drug library.
{% endhint %}

## Entering lab or imaging results

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Open the relevant case study in Course Designer Mode
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Sign in as the appropriate healthcare professional

For example, Doctor for orders.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Navigate to the patient chart
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Go to Reports and Documents

Or the equivalent section in your case study.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Add a new lab or imaging requisition

* Enter the order details (test type, date, etc.).
* Add the corresponding results in the appropriate field.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Save your changes
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** Make sure each lab or imaging result has a matching requisition for realism and completeness.
{% endhint %}

## Assigning or editing MRNs

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Locate the MRN field

When creating or editing a case study, find the MRN (Medical Record Number) field.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Enter a unique identifier

For example, "12345T2W1" for Term 2, Week 1.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Stick to a consistent format

Use the same format across your cases for easy tracking.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** Use a format that makes sense for your team and is easy to search or filter.
{% endhint %}

## Switching user roles for documentation

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Sign in as the role you need

While editing a case study, sign in as the appropriate role (e.g., Nurse, Doctor).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Enter the relevant documentation

Add nursing notes, orders, or other role-specific content.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Switch roles as needed

Sign out and back in as another role if you need to add documentation from a different perspective.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** This keeps your case study realistic and helps students see the workflow from multiple roles.
