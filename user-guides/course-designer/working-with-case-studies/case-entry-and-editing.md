## Adding a Medication Record to a Case Study

### Step-by-Step Guide:

4. Navigate to the medication orders section of the case.

   3. Enter the dose, route, and any other required details.
6. Save your changes.
7. (Optional) If the medication isn’t in the library, document your process and notify your admin or support contact.
