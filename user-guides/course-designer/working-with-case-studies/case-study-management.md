# Case Study Management

### Case Study Management

Additional options for managing Case Studies:

**Viewing the EHR Content**:

* Both Instructors and Content Creators can view EHR data in "Condensed View"
* This shows just the data without the full EHR charting interface

**Importing a Case Study**:

* Use the import button to upload a previously saved Case Study
* Select a JSON file containing a case study that you or someone else created

**Downloading a Case Study**:

* Save a Case Study as a JSON file
* These can be used as backups or to share with other instructors
* The saved file contains structured text in JSON format
* Each saved file contains a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which you can remove if desired

**Viewing Metadata**:

* Each Case Study has metadata that includes:
  * EHR statistics: List of EHR pages in the data
  * Learning Objects using this seed: Shows how many Learning Objects use this Case Study

### Sharing Case Studies

You can share Case Studies with other instructors in two ways:

**Method 1: Within the same EdEHR instance**:

* Have the other person find the case study by name in their Case Studies list
* They will need to enable "Course designer mode" to edit the case

**Method 2: Via file transfer**:

1. Download your case study as a JSON file
2. Email the file to your colleague
3. Have them visit edehr.org and select "EHR Only Demonstration"
4. They should select any case study (it doesn't matter which)
5. Have them use the Import button and select your file
6. The EHR demo will display your case study

### Keeping Case Study Change Log

Why keep a change log? A change log documents every update made to a case study in EdEHR. This helps maintain accuracy, track changes over time, and provides transparency for anyone working with the case.

When to use the change log:

* Before making any edits or updates to a case study, always download and save the current version as a backup.
* After any change, big or small, immediately record the details in the change log.

Suggestions to include in your entry:

* Case Study Name and MRN: Clearly identify which case was changed.
* Term: Note the relevant term or course.
* Date and Time: Record when the change was made.
* Changes Made: Briefly describe what was updated. Be specific (e.g., “Updated patient history to include new lab results” or “Modified medication list to reflect guideline changes”).
* Reason for Change: State why the change was needed (e.g., “Align with new clinical guidelines” or “Correct data entry error”).
* Requested By: Record who asked for the change.
* Approved By: Record who authorized the change.
* Additional Notes: Add any extra details that might help future users understand the context.

Tips and Recommendations:

* Use the provided template for consistency. This ensures all necessary details are recorded and makes it easier to review changes later.
* Make change log entries right after you make updates — don’t wait until later.
* Review the change log periodically. This helps spot recurring issues and keeps everyone on the same page.
* Store your change log in a shared location accessible to all team members involved in case development and maintenance.
* For major updates or recurring issues, include more detailed notes or references to related documents.

Remember: Keeping a thorough change log isn’t just good practice — it’s essential for quality control and collaboration in EdEHR.

#### Tip from BCIT

BCIT uses a straightforward change log to keep track of edits to case studies. While using a change log is optional, it helps teams stay organized and makes it easy to see what’s changed and why.

A typical change log entry includes the case study name and MRN, the term, date and time of the change, what was updated, the reason for the change, who requested it, who approved it, and any extra notes.

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="268.234375">Case Study Change Log Example</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Case Study Name:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>MRN:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Term: </td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th>Date &#x26; Time</th><th>Changes Made</th><th>Reason for Change</th><th>Requested By</th><th>Approved By</th><th>Additional Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

What works well is saving a backup before making edits, logging changes right away, and keeping the log in a shared folder. Using a consistent format helps everyone quickly find the information they need.
