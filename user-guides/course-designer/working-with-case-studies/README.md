## Linking Case Study to a Learning Object

After creating a Case Study, you need to connect it to a Learning Object so students can access it through an activity.

For detailed step-by-step instructions, see: [Linking Case Study to a Learning Object](linking-case-study-to-a-learning-object.md)

Additional options for managing Case Studies:

  * EHR statistics: List of EHR pages in the data
  * Learning Objects using this seed: Shows how many Learning Objects use this Case Study

### Sharing Case Studies

You can share Case Studies with other instructors in two ways:

**Method 1: Within the same EdEHR instance**:

* Have the other person find the case study by name in their Case Studies list
* They will need to enable "Course designer mode" to edit the case

**Method 2: Via file transfer**:

1. Download your case study as a JSON file
2. Email the file to your colleague
3. Have them visit edehr.org and select "EHR Only Demonstration"
4. They should select any case study (it doesn't matter which)
5. Have them use the Import button and select your file
6. The EHR demo will display your case study
