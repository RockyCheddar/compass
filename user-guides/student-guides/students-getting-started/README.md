# Student's Getting Started

Welcome to EdEHR! This guide will walk you through how to access the system, navigate the interface, and complete your activities.

💡 **Quick Tip:** You’ll hear the term **LMS** a lot. It just means **Learning Management System**—the online platform your school uses for classes. Examples include Blackboard, Brightspace, Canvas, D2L, or Moodle.  Each school often has a name for their LMS. For example, "Learning Hub", etc

👉 The important part: you don’t log in to **EdEHR** directly. You’ll always get to EdEHR by clicking a link provided inside your school’s LMS.

### How to Access EdEHR

### Tips

* After you submit an assignment, the dashboard will update to show your status and any feedback from your instructor.
* If you ever get lost, use the dashboard navigation to quickly find your way back to your courses or activities.
* The “exit to LMS” link takes you back to your main course page in your school’s LMS. If you do not see this link it is because your LMS does not support this feature.&#x20;

Spend a few minutes exploring the dashboard so you know where everything lives. It’s the quickest way to get comfortable in EdEHR and stay on top of your assignments.
