### Confirm device connections

Before you start, make sure your keyboard and scanner are connected to the iPad via Bluetooth. If either device is in sleep mode, pressing any button will wake it up and reconnect.

### Troubleshooting Tips

* If your scanner isn’t working, check that it’s connected via Bluetooth and not in sleep mode.
* Make sure you are scanning the correct patient and medication. If you scan the wrong one, the field won’t populate.
* If all else fails, turn off the keyboard (sometimes this helps with scanning issues) and try again.
* If you’re still stuck, ask your facilitator or simulation tech for help.

By following these steps and using the right barcodes, you’ll be ready to document medication administration in EdEHR just like in a real clinical setting.
