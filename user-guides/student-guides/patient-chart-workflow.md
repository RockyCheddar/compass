# Patient Chart Workflow

This page walks you through a typical “charting session” from opening the patient to saving a verified report and getting ready to submit your work.

### Enter or update Patient Chart Data

1. Select the relevant page in health record navigation (e.g., _Demographics_ or _Medication Administration_)
2. Depending on the data there may be an **Edit form button or an 'Add Assessment' button which will bring up a pop up for additional details.**&#x20;

### Repeat this process for every required Patient Chart&#x20;

### Tracking your Changes

You will notice greyed dots which represent your changes to the patient data. A solid circle represents saved form changes by you. Empty circle represents Case Study data has been unchanged. You can use this to guide your progress through the EHR.&#x20;

### Ready to submit your work?

Once all your changes are made to the EHR you will be ready to submit.&#x20;

Click **Submit**, confirm the pop-up, and edEHR locks the chart and redirects you to the **Activity** page. From there you can monitor grading status and feedback.
