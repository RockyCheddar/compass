# Receiving Feedback

After you submit your work, your instructor will review your chart and provide feedback. There are two possible outcomes:

**1. Further Work Required**\
If your instructor decides that more work is needed, your chart will be unlocked and sent back to you for revisions.  Make the necessary changes, then resubmit your work by following the original submission steps.

**2. Feedback Provided**\
If your submission is complete, your instructor will leave feedback on the Activity page. You can view comments and suggestions by returning to the Activity page.&#x20;

Always check the Activity page after submitting your work to stay up to date on your status and any instructor feedback.
