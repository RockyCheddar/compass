# Workstation Equipment and Setup

The setup of your simulation workstations should be tailored to your program, the number of students, and your specific EdEHR use case. Well-equipped stations make simulations smoother and more realistic. Here are some practical guidelines to help you design and equip your stations for effective simulation labs.

#### How BCIT does Workstations

As a point of reference, BCIT has found success by matching their station setups to their needs. They use full Workstations on Wheels for hands-on labs and partial setups for smaller sessions. This flexible approach helps ensure every simulation runs smoothly, no matter the group size or activity.

### Complete Workstation on Wheels (WOW)&#x20;

A full WOW station is ideal for simulations. Each station generally includes:&#x20;

* Rolling table
* iPad with keyboard case
* Barcode scanner and scanner stand
* Hand sanitizer
* Paper bag for garbage (taped to the side)
* Medication supplies as needed

### Partial Workstation&#x20;

For labs or smaller setups, a partial station might be enough.&#x20;

This usually includes:&#x20;

* iPad with keyboard case&#x20;
* Barcode scanner and stand
* Paper bag for garbage

### Student-Supplied Devices&#x20;

For theory or remote work, students can use their own devices. Make sure they know in advance what they’ll need.&#x20;

### General Tips

* Match the number on each iPad to its keyboard and scanner for easy troubleshooting
* Charge all devices before use and between sessions&#x20;
* Set up and test barcode scanners and medication labels before the simulation starts&#x20;
* Store all equipment lists and setup instructions where everyone can access them

Customize your setup based on your space, simulation goals, and available equipment. Add images or diagrams to your guide to make set up even easier for your team.
