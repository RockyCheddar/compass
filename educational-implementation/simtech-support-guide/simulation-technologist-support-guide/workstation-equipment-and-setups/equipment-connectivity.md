### Connectivity Tips&#x20;

* Make sure each iPad connects to the matching keyboard and scanner. The numbers on the devices should match for easy pairing.
* Connect keyboards and scanners to iPads using Bluetooth. **Always check that devices are fully charged before use.**
* If a device isn’t working, check the Bluetooth settings on the iPad to confirm it’s paired with the correct keyboard or scanner. If not, use “Forget Device” and reconnect.
* To put a scanner into Bluetooth mode, either hold the button for 8 to 10 seconds or use the provided QR code. A blue light on the scanner means it’s ready to pair.
* Never forget keyboards from the Bluetooth menu only scanners.
* Charge all devices after use and between sessions to avoid interruptions.

Keep these steps handy to make setup and troubleshooting quick and easy for your team.
