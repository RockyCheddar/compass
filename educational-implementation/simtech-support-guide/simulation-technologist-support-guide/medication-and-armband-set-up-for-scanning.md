# Medication and Armband Set-Up for Scanning

This guide is for faculty and simulation techs responsible for preparing medication and patient armband barcodes for use with EdEHR’s scanning features. Following these steps will help ensure accurate medication administration practice and smooth-running simulations, no matter your institution.

#### Purpose

To walk you through creating, labeling, and verifying barcodes for medications and patient armbands, so your learners can scan and document medications just like they would in a real clinical setting.

#### Who Should Use This Guide

* Simulation coordinators and faculty
* Simulation technologists and lab support staff

## Step-by-Step Set-Up Process

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Generate Medication and Patient Barcodes

* For each new case or any changes to medications, generate a medication list and patient barcode labels from EdEHR or your institution’s barcode system.
* Each patient in a scenario needs a unique armband barcode. Each medication (with correct drug name and dose) also needs a barcode.
* Make sure Course Designer Mode is enabled, then log in to the EHR interface. Open the case study you want to edit and click the **Patient Summary** in the top right corner.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Save and Distribute Barcodes

* Save patient summaries and all generated QR codes/barcodes to a secure, accessible location (e.g., a shared drive or simulation folder).
* Share medication and armband barcode sheets with your simulation techs or whoever is prepping the supplies.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Create Patient Armbands

* Print and assemble armband labels for each patient. The barcode should be based on the patient’s unique identifier (such as MRN, name, term, and session).
* Make sure armbands are durable enough for repeated use during simulation sessions.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Label Medications

* Print and attach barcode labels to each medication package (e.g., pill bag, syringe, or bottle).
* Each label should include the patient’s name, medication name, dose, and any other relevant identifiers for the scenario.
* Place medications in clearly labeled containers (zip bags work well and can be reused).

> _**Example:**_\
> MADISON, Terry #4321234T2\
> 6.25mg (One Part Tab)\
> Captopril 12.5mg TAB
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Test All Barcodes

* All new case studies with medication QR Codes and patient arms bands should be scanned after labeling to verify functionality.
* Before simulation day, scan every patient armband and medication barcode using the devices that will be used in the session.
* Confirm that each barcode pulls up the correct information in EdEHR.
* If a barcode is not working, double-check that the medication name and patient details match exactly between the label and the EdEHR entry. Correct any mismatches and reprint as needed.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

#### Troubleshooting Tips

* If a barcode still won’t scan, check device connectivity and battery levels.
* Ensure you are using the most up-to-date medication library or barcode source.
* If issues persist, consult your EdEHR administrator or technical support team.<br>

#### Best Practices

* Always use standardized medication and patient lists to reduce errors.
* Store barcode sheets and labels securely to maintain patient confidentiality in simulated scenarios.
* Reuse armbands and medication containers when possible, but verify barcodes each time to prevent mix-ups.
* Keep a small supply of blank labels and a printer handy for last-minute changes.



By following these steps, you’ll set your learners up for safe, realistic medication administration practice and minimize simulation day hiccups.
