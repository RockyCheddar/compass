### Why Use Readiness Planning Tools?

Launching EdEHR involves more than just turning on the system. It requires coordinated planning across curriculum, faculty, students, and technology. These tools help you cover all your bases, streamline onboarding, and set your program up for sustainable success.

### Key Planning Tools

**1. Integration Mapping Template**\
Chart which terms, courses, and groups will use each level of EdEHR (data collection, data entry, full evaluation). This helps visualize your rollout and identify where additional support may be needed.

**2. Lesson Plan & Curriculum Checklist**\
Review your lesson plans to ensure EdEHR activities align with concepts, competencies, and learning outcomes. Use the checklist to spot gaps and plan for updates.

**3. Faculty & Student Orientation Agendas**\
Sample agendas for onboarding sessions. Includes timing, topics, and recommended activities for both faculty and students.

**4. Technology Readiness Checklist**\
Make sure your IT infrastructure, devices, and connectivity are up to the task. Includes prompts for AV/IT support and equipment needs.

**5. Evaluation & Feedback Templates**\
Tools for collecting feedback from faculty and students after each implementation phase. Use these to inform ongoing improvements and share lessons learned.
