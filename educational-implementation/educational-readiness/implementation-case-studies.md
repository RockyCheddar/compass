# Implementation Case Studies

## Implementation Case Studies: Real-World Examples from EdEHR Integration

This section highlights practical examples and lessons learned from integrating EdEHR into educational programs. These case studies draw from actual rollout experiences, planning templates, and feedback gathered during the early phases of EdEHR adoption.

***

### Example 1: Progressive Integration Across Program Terms

BSN at BCIT used a mapped rollout plan to introduce EdEHR in stages. Starting with Level 1 (data collection only) in early terms, they gradually advanced to Level 2 (data entry and medication administration) and Level 3 (full feedback and evaluation) in later terms. This scaffolded approach allowed faculty and students to build confidence while aligning with curriculum goals and clinical realities.

**Key takeaways:**

* Start simple and scale up as readiness grows
* Use a template to track which groups and terms are using each level of EdEHR
* Plan for hybrid documentation if some clinical sites remain paper-based

***

### Example 2: Curriculum and Faculty Readiness

Institutions launching EdEHR found that intensive planning sessions and early faculty orientation were critical to success. Teams scheduled virtual and in-person meetings to review lesson plans, update cases, and ensure everyone was comfortable with the platform. Ongoing orientation and support for new faculty helped maintain momentum.

**Key takeaways:**

* Invest in early, repeated faculty development sessions
* Designate EdEHR champions to support their colleagues
* Build in time for hands-on practice and Q\&A

### Example 3: Student Orientation and Feedback

Programs included EdEHR orientation in course hours, combining self-paced modules with in-class activities. Feedback was collected from students after their first use, and adjustments were made to improve both the technology and instructional approach. Open lab times and success activities also helped students get comfortable with EdEHR before they encountered it in simulation or clinical settings.

**Key takeaways:**

* Schedule orientation and lab time for students to explore EdEHR
* Use surveys and informal feedback to identify pain points early
* Integrate EdEHR activities into existing curriculum wherever possible

### Lessons Learned

* Hybrid EHR and paper environments require extra planning and coordination with placement coordinators
* Faculty and student success improves with clear communication, orientation, and ongoing support
* Mapping integration and evaluation plans helps track progress and keeps everyone aligned
