## Curriculum Integration Models: Approaches for Incorporating EdEHR

This guide explores practical models and strategies for integrating EdEHR into your curriculum. Whether you’re just starting out or looking to deepen your program’s use of digital health simulation, you’ll find examples, templates, and planning considerations to support a smooth rollout.

> **Note:** The examples, templates, and lessons shared in this guide are drawn from nursing programs and other health professions education institutions that have successfully implemented EdEHR. While these resources reflect diverse program experiences, the strategies and tools can be adapted to fit your institution's specific educational settings and disciplines.

### Why Integration Models Matter

A well-planned integration ensures EdEHR supports your learning outcomes, fits your program structure, and meets the needs of both students and faculty. Thoughtful models help you scaffold learning, align with clinical realities, and adapt to evolving technology.

***

### Levels of EdEHR Integration

EdEHR can be implemented at different levels, each with unique curriculum and readiness needs:

**Level 1: Data Collection Only**

* Students use EdEHR to retrieve and review health data
* Ideal for early exposure and foundational informatics skills

**Level 2: Data Collection and Entry**

* Adds documentation and medication administration tasks
* Supports development of digital charting and safe med admin practices

**Level 3: Data Collection, Entry, and Feedback/Evaluation**

* Incorporates instructor feedback and assessment within EdEHR
* Enables robust evaluation of student performance and clinical judgment

You can move through these levels progressively or tailor them to specific courses or cohorts.

### Curriculum Planning Considerations

* **Competency and Outcome Alignment:** Map EdEHR activities to your program’s competencies and learning outcomes. Include digital documentation, clinical judgment, and informatics.
* **Simulation Best Practices:** Design EdEHR cases using recognized standards for simulation. Aim for realism and opportunities for feedback.
* **Hybrid Environments:** If your program uses both paper and electronic records (due to partial EHR rollout in clinical sites), plan for dual approaches. Collaborate with placement coordinators to ensure consistency and manage equipment needs.
* **Faculty and Student Preparation:** Schedule orientation, training, and ongoing support for both groups. Identify team champions for peer-to-peer support.

***

### Practical Tools and Templates

* **Rollout Mapping Template:** Chart EdEHR integration across terms, groups, and clinical sites to visualize progression and coverage.
* **Lesson Plan Examples:** Use sample lesson plans to see how EdEHR activities can be embedded in existing courses.
* **Checklists:** Develop checklists for curriculum leads and instructors to ensure all integration steps are addressed.

***

### Tips for Success

* Start with pilot groups or select courses before scaling up
* Gather feedback from faculty and students after each implementation stage
* Regularly review and update EdEHR cases and integration plans to reflect evolving best practices and technology

By using flexible integration models and planning tools, you can make EdEHR a seamless part of your curriculum, supporting both student learning and program goals. For more resources, see our guides on pedagogical frameworks, assessment strategies, and readiness planning.
