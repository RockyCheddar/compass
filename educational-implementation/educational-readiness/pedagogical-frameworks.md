## Pedagogical Frameworks: Educational Theories Supporting EHR Simulation

Welcome to the Pedagogical Frameworks guide for EdEHR implementation. This page outlines the core educational theories and models that inform how EdEHR is used to support learning in simulated and clinical environments. Understanding these frameworks will help you design, deliver, and evaluate EdEHR activities that truly enhance student learning.

> **Note:** The examples, templates, and lessons shared in this guide are drawn from the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT). While these resources reflect the experiences of a large, established program, the strategies and tools can be adapted to fit a variety of educational settings and disciplines.

### Why Pedagogical Frameworks Matter

A pedagogical framework provides the foundation for how teaching and learning are structured. For EdEHR, this means grounding simulation activities and digital documentation in proven educational models, ensuring that students gain not just technical skills but also clinical judgment, professionalism, and informatics competency.

### Key Frameworks Underpinning EdEHR

#### Simulation-Based Learning

EdEHR leverages simulation best practices (such as those outlined by INACSL) to create safe, realistic environments for students to practice and develop clinical skills. Simulation-based learning emphasizes:

* Active, experiential learning through realistic scenarios
* Opportunities for reflection, feedback, and iterative improvement
* Bridging the gap between theory and practice

#### Competency-Based Education

Activities and assessments in EdEHR are designed around clear competencies and learning outcomes, such as those set by BCCNM. This approach ensures students can:

* Demonstrate proficiency in nursing informatics and digital documentation
* Apply clinical judgment to real-world scenarios
* Meet regulatory and professional standards

#### Scaffolding and Progressive Integration

EdEHR supports multiple levels of integration, allowing for a scaffolded approach:

* Level 1: Data collection only
* Level 2: Data collection and entry (including medication administration)
* Level 3: Data collection, entry, and feedback/evaluation

This progression helps students and faculty build confidence and skills incrementally, matching readiness with increasing complexity.

### Best Practice Principles

* **Alignment with Curriculum:** EdEHR activities are mapped to concepts, competencies, and learning outcomes relevant to digital health, documentation, and patient safety.
* **Simulation Standards:** Cases are developed in line with simulation best practices, ensuring fidelity and educational value.
* **Faculty and Student Support:** Ongoing orientation, training, and feedback loops are built into the framework to sustain effective teaching and learning.

### Putting It into Practice

When designing EdEHR activities, consider:

* Which competencies and learning outcomes are being targeted?
* How will simulation scenarios promote active learning and reflection?
* What level of integration is appropriate for your learners?
* How will you scaffold learning experiences to build skills over time?

By grounding your EdEHR implementation in these pedagogical frameworks, you’re setting students up for success—not just in simulation, but in real-world clinical practice.
