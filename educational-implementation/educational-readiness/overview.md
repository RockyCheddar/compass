# Overview

## Educational Readiness Overview

Welcome to the Educational Readiness hub for EdEHR implementation. This section is your starting point for planning a successful rollout, whether you’re introducing EdEHR to a single course or embedding it across an entire program.

Here, you’ll find practical guides, frameworks, and tools designed to help curriculum leads, faculty, and support staff prepare for every stage of EdEHR adoption. From understanding the educational theories that shape our approach, to mapping out curriculum integration, to crafting assessment strategies and learning from real-world case studies, this section covers it all.

The resources and examples provided are drawn from nursing and health professions programs that have successfully implemented EdEHR. While they reflect diverse program experiences, everything here can be adapted for your own institutional context and needs.

Explore the subpages for step-by-step guidance on:

* [Pedagogical frameworks that support simulation-based learning](pedagogical-frameworks.md)
* [Models for integrating EdEHR into your curriculum](curriculum-integration-models.md)
* [Assessment strategies for meaningful evaluation of student learning](assessment-strategies.md)
* [Case studies and planning tools to support your readiness journey](implementation-case-studies.md)

No matter where you are in the process, this section is here to help you build a strong foundation for EdEHR success.
