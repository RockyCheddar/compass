## Assessment Strategies: Methods for Evaluating Student Performance in EdEHR

This guide outlines practical strategies for assessing student learning and performance within EdEHR activities. By aligning assessment with your curriculum’s competencies and learning outcomes, you’ll ensure students are developing essential skills in digital documentation, clinical judgment, and informatics.

> **Note:** The examples, templates, and lessons shared in this guide are drawn from the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT). While these resources reflect the experiences of a large, established program, the strategies and tools can be adapted to fit a variety of educational settings and disciplines.

### Why Assessment Strategies Matter

Effective assessment doesn’t just measure what students know—it helps guide their growth, provides actionable feedback, and ensures your EdEHR integration supports both learning and regulatory standards.

### Core Approaches to Assessment in EdEHR

#### Competency-Based Assessment

EdEHR activities align with clear competencies, such as those set by BCCNM and your program’s learning outcomes. Assessments focus on students’ ability to:

* Use electronic health records accurately and efficiently
* Demonstrate safe medication administration practices
* Apply clinical judgment in simulated scenarios
* Meet professional and regulatory documentation standards

#### Simulation-Based Evaluation

Assessment within EdEHR leverages simulation best practices, including:

* Using realistic scenarios to observe student decision-making
* Providing opportunities for formative feedback and improvement
* Incorporating both individual and team-based evaluations

#### Rubrics and Feedback Tools

Develop or adapt rubrics that address:

* Accuracy and completeness of documentation
* Clinical reasoning and judgment
* Communication and professionalism
* Adherence to safety protocols

Feedback can be delivered directly within EdEHR, including rubric scores, inline comments, and file attachments. This supports transparency and helps students understand areas for improvement.

### Planning and Process

* **Align assessment tools with learning outcomes and competencies**
* **Orient students to assessment criteria before activities begin**
* **Include both formative (during learning) and summative (end of activity) assessments**
* **Gather feedback from students and faculty to refine assessment strategies**

***

### Sample Assessment Tools

* **Lesson plan examples** with built-in assessment checkpoints
* **Checklists for instructors** to ensure all evaluation criteria are met
* **Student self-assessment prompts** to encourage reflection and ownership of learning

***

### Tips for Success

* Regularly review and update rubrics to reflect evolving best practices
* Use assessment data to identify trends and inform curriculum improvements
* Encourage students to engage with feedback as part of their learning journey
