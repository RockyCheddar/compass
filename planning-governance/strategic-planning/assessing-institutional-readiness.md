### Assessing Institutional Readiness

Before implementing an educational EHR like EdEHR, institutions should conduct a comprehensive readiness assessment. The SCORS framework (Simulation Culture Organizational Readiness Survey) provides a structured lens to evaluate both operational and cultural preparedness.

### Defined Need for Change

**(Strategic Alignment & Institutional Goals)**

Assess whether there is a clearly recognized need and strategic drive to integrate an educational EHR system.

**Key Questions:**

* Is there a clear strategic objective to integrate EHR training into healthcare education?
* How does an educational EHR align with accreditation standards and competency frameworks?
* Is there leadership support for implementation?

**Assessment Actions:**

* Conduct interviews with leadership, faculty, and students to understand perceptions and needs.
* Identify program-specific EHR competency requirements (e.g., nursing, MLS).
* Map EHR integration to curriculum goals and interprofessional learning outcomes.

***

### Readiness for Culture Change

**(Faculty & Student Adoption)**

Evaluate institutional readiness to embrace simulation-based training and EHR tool adoption.

**Key Questions:**

* Are faculty comfortable with EHR technology and simulation pedagogy?
* What is the expected student learning curve?
* Are support structures (e.g., training, help desk) in place?

**Assessment Actions:**

* Distribute faculty readiness surveys.
* Offer professional development workshops for faculty.
* Run student pilot sessions to gather UX and learning feedback.

***

### Time, Personnel, and Resource Readiness

**(Financial & IT Commitment)**

Determine the institution’s ability to support the technical and operational demands of an EHR.

**Key Questions:**

* What are the total implementation costs (licenses, hosting, IT, faculty time)?
* What are the available funding streams (grants, internal budgets)?
* Does IT have the infrastructure and capacity to support EdEHR?
* Are privacy and security standards (FOIPPA, etc.) met?

**Assessment Actions:**

* Compare in-house hosting vs. SaaS models (e.g., EdEHR).
* Consult with your institution’s privacy officer to ensure compliance.

***

### Sustainability Practices

**(Risk Management & Long-Term Viability)**

Consider whether the EHR initiative can be maintained and grown over time.

**Key Questions:**

* Are there risks related to vendor dependency or custom development?
* Can the solution scale with enrollment growth and curriculum expansion?
* What’s the long-term plan for funding and maintenance?

**Assessment Actions:**

* Create a vendor risk mitigation strategy (e.g., legal agreements, documentation).
* Choose an EHR system with proven scalability and adaptability.
