## EdEHR Implementation Guide

After completing your institutional readiness assessment using the SCORS framework, this guide provides a structured approach to implementing EdEHR in your program.

### Who This Guide Is For

Simulation directors, coordinators, educators and those responsible for decision making and implementing new simulation learning activities.

### Implementation Process Overview

1. [**Detailed Needs Assessment**](edehr-implementation-guide.md#id-1.-detailed-needs-assessment)
2. [**Program Planning & Consultation**](edehr-implementation-guide.md#id-2.-program-planning-and-consultation)
3. [**Faculty Onboarding & Training**](edehr-implementation-guide.md#id-3.-faculty-onboarding-and-training)
4. [**Student Orientation**](edehr-implementation-guide.md#id-4.-student-orientation)
5. [**Ongoing Support & Evaluation**](edehr-implementation-guide.md#id-5.-ongoing-support-and-evaluation)

### 1. Detailed Needs Assessment

#### Current State Analysis

* **Existing Technology**: Assess current EHR systems and technologies in use
* **Technical Infrastructure**: Evaluate device availability (computers, tablets, scanners) and internet connectivity
* **Faculty & Staff Readiness**: Determine current level of EHR experience and training needs
* **Student Needs**: Assess previous exposure to EHR systems and establish expected competencies

#### Goals & Objectives

* **Program Goals**: Define primary objectives for EdEHR integration
* **Desired Outcomes**: Specify expected outcomes (improved documentation skills, medication safety, etc.)
* **Curriculum Alignment**: Map EdEHR usage to program curriculum and accreditation standards

#### System Requirements

* **Essential Features**: Identify critical EHR features for simulation activities
* **User Access**: Determine number of users requiring system access
* **Technical Specifications**: Establish minimum requirements for devices and software
* **Privacy Considerations**: Address PIA requirements

#### Resource Assessment

* **Budget & Equipment**: Identify equipment needs (scanners, iPads, Ergotron tables)
* **Training Requirements**: Plan for faculty, technical staff, and student training
* **Support & Maintenance**: Develop sustainability plan for ongoing implementation

### 2. Program Planning & Consultation

#### Initial Planning Session (Virtual, 45-60 minutes)

* Review integration process
* Introduction to EdEHR platform
* Review learning plans and cases
* Plan faculty and student onboarding sessions
* Arrange beta-testing if needed
* Identify curriculum update requirements
* Integrate EdEHR into learning management system
* Set calendar dates for all implementation activities

### 3. Faculty Onboarding & Training

#### Faculty Introduction (Virtual, 30-45 minutes)

* Basic platform orientation
* Finalize case development needs
* Access instructions via learning system
* Identify team champions

#### Faculty Training (In-person, 45-60 minutes)

* Walk through term-specific laboratory exercises
* Hands-on practice with EdEHR features

#### Optional Refresh Sessions

* Additional training as needed prior to first use
* In-person lab support during initial implementation

### 4. Student Orientation

#### Orientation Structure

* 30 minutes pre-work (Review RISE module)
* 30-45 minutes class time (Zoom escape room or seek & find activities)
* Hands-on practice in campus labs

### 5. Ongoing Support & Evaluation

#### Support Resources

* EdEHR documentation and help guides
* Technical support contacts
* Trello Board
* EdEHR website resources

#### Evaluation Plan

* Collect feedback from faculty and students
* Regular assessment of implementation success
