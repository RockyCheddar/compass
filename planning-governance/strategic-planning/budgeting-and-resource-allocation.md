# Budgeting & Resource Allocation

## Budgeting & Resource Allocation in Health Education Programs

Careful budgeting and resource allocation are essential for successfully implementing and sustaining EdEHR across a variety of health education programs. Whether your program uses high-fidelity simulation labs, classroom-based activities, or a blend of both, this guide covers the key considerations for technology, personnel, and learning environments that support effective digital health education.

***

### Why It Matters

Health education programs can vary widely in their use of simulation, digital platforms, and hands-on learning. Planning your budget with attention to your unique context helps ensure EdEHR is integrated smoothly, supports your learning goals, and remains sustainable over time.

***

### Key Areas to Plan For

#### Technology & Equipment

* Devices for student and faculty use (laptops, tablets, desktops — institution-provided or BYOD)
* Reliable internet connectivity for on-campus and remote access
* _If using EdEHR in a simulation lab_: EHR stations, carts, scanners, or other sim-center equipment

#### Learning Materials & Supplies

* Digital resources, demo medications, armbands, or other consumables as needed for activities
* Ongoing replenishment of supplies and maintenance of any specialized equipment

#### Faculty & Support Staff

* Time and funding for faculty to develop, pilot, and refine EdEHR activities
* Simulation technologists or IT support staff, if applicable, for setup, troubleshooting, and maintenance
* Professional development for faculty and staff in digital health, simulation, or online teaching best practices

#### Student Support & Orientation

* Orientation sessions or onboarding modules to introduce students to EdEHR, whether in-person or online
* Open lab hours or virtual office hours for student questions and practice
* Peer mentors or helpdesk resources for ongoing support

#### Software & Licensing

* **EdEHR access based on active students (no per-user licenses)**
* **Upgrades included with the service**
* **One-time LMS integration setup**

#### Evaluation & Quality Improvement

* Tools and staff time for collecting and analyzing feedback and performance data
* Resources for curriculum review, updating digital content, and responding to evolving best practices

#### Collaboration & External Funding

* Opportunities to share digital resources or EdEHR access with other programs or departments
* Pursuing grants, sponsorships, or external funding for digital health or educational innovation

### Health Education Budgeting Checklist

* Have you included all technology, equipment, and digital content costs?
* Are faculty development and student support needs addressed?
* Is your budget flexible enough to adapt to changes in teaching methods or technology?
* Do you have a process for evaluating outcomes and updating resources?
* Are you exploring partnerships or grants to maximize your resources?

***

### Tips for Diverse Health Education Settings

* Pilot EdEHR activities with a small group to identify hidden costs and resource needs
* Involve all key stakeholders—faculty, IT, support staff, and students—in the planning process
* Build flexibility into your budget for scaling up or adopting new tools and approaches
* Document your process and lessons learned for future planning and continuous improvement
