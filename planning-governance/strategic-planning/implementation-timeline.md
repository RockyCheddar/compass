# Implementation Timeline

This timeline outlines the key steps, estimated timeframes, and practical considerations for bringing EdEHR to your institution. The process is broken down into clear phases, with onboarding details drawn directly from the experiences and recommendations shared by Bryan Gilbert.

***

### Phase 0: Needs Assessment and Readiness&#x20;

**Duration**: 1 to 2 months

* Stakeholder Engagement: Consult with faculty, IT, administration, and students to clarify goals and expectations.
* Current State Review: Map existing workflows, technology, and resources.
* Gap Analysis: Identify what’s needed to support EdEHR implementation (skills, infrastructure, support).
* Readiness Check: Assess institutional capacity and commitment to support the project.

***

### Phase 1: Planning and Preparation

**Duration:** 2-3 weeks

* **Project Team Formation:** Assemble your core team and identify faculty champions.
* **Service Agreement:** Establish a software service agreement with EdEHR. This is a standard contract negotiation and signing process.
* **Privacy Impact Assessment:** Conduct a privacy review to ensure EdEHR meets your institution’s privacy and data protection standards. This typically involves an hour-long session with privacy officers, plus additional review time as needed.
* **IT Security Review:** Your IT department reviews the platform for security compliance and integration. Plan for a main discussion of about an hour, with possible follow-up.
* **LMS Integration:** Set up EdEHR with your learning management system (such as Moodle, D2L, or Canvas) in an interactive, real-time session that takes about an hour.
* **Calendar Planning:** Time your setup to align with the academic calendar, and ensure IT support is available during onboarding.

### Phase 2: Faculty Training and Content Preparation

**Duration:** 1 to 2 months

* **Faculty Training:**
  * Initial orientation for all teachers using EdEHR (one to two hours).
  * Deeper training for those creating course content (up to a day, spread over several weeks).
* **Student Orientation:** Quick and simple, typically just fifteen minutes.
* **Course and Content Creation:** Faculty build or import course materials into EdEHR, using resources from the EdEHR Compass guide or their own collections.
* **Pilot and Demo Mode:** Schools may use a fully operational demonstration or pilot instance to develop content and get familiar with the platform before launching live courses.

***

### Phase 3: Pilot Launch and Full Rollout

**Duration:** 2 to 4 months

* **Pilot Launch:** Start with one or two small courses. Provide extra support to students and faculty, gather feedback, and address any issues.
* **Iterative Improvement:** Use lessons learned from the pilot to refine your approach, improve support processes, and update training as needed.
* **Full Rollout:** Gradually expand EdEHR to more courses and programs. Build internal expertise and documentation. Develop best practices and establish sustainable support systems, including ongoing faculty development.
* **Resource Sharing:** Create a repository for case studies and teaching resources, and consider collaborating with other institutions for greater impact.

***

### Ongoing Support and Scalability

* The technical setup for EdEHR is quick and can be scaled efficiently across multiple schools.
* The main time investment is in faculty training and content creation.
* As the platform grows, comprehensive support documentation and train-the-trainer models can streamline onboarding and reduce the burden on individual support staff.

***

### Typical Total Timeline

Most institutions are up and running within an academic year. Smaller schools with straightforward LMS setups and strong IT support may be ready in six to eight months. Larger or more complex environments may take closer to a year.

***

### Bottom Line

A solid plan, a small-scale start, and a focus on building momentum and internal capacity are the keys to successful EdEHR implementation.
